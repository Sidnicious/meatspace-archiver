# Meatspace-Cleaver.js

It's a terminal read-only Meatspace Chat client. That's it. I didn't want to keep the Meatspace window open all the time, but I also wanted to keep an eye on what's happening in the chatroom. I have a problem.

## Usage

```bash
npm install -g meatspace-cleaver
meatcleaver
```

`ctrl+c` to exit and embrace FOMO.

## Channels

You can specify which subdomain you're connecting to by passing it as an argument.

```bash
meatcleaver -c fr
meatcleaver -c es
meatcleaver -c chat
```

This does not work for the staging server because I am lazy.
